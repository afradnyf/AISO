# Ansatz-Independent Shadow Optimization

Here is the python implementation of Ansatz-Independent Shadow Optimisation (AISO), developed by Afrad Basheer, Yuan Feng, Chris Ferrie, and Sanjiang Li. The performance of AISO can be measured against that of traditional VQA.
If you want to utilise the code, please think about citing our publication.

You can reach me at Afrad.M.Basheer@student.uts.edu.au with comments and suggestions.
